# Welcome to Port Nave

Welcome to **Port Nave**, where things are a bit oddly structured.  
Website hosted by GitHub. Above, there is a badge named **My Room** where the website lies. So, if you want to sail there, just click the badge, and you’ll be there.  
But beware—there are many catches before you set sail. Know your place, as there's an **Unknown Being Crawling** there, watching for your life (data).

## Testing Games In Linux

**Testme117** is my YouTube channel where I test games via **Wine** and **Proton**.  

- Sometimes, I also make gameplay videos.  

- I notify changes in tools and ProtonDB, the respected games forum, when possible.  

- I check in on the community to see where Linux is going in gaming or software (and leave some messages there).

You can find my YouTube channel via the **Yellow Badge** below, or just go through my profile.

## Shoelace

**Shoelace** is simply the way I like to do things—free, flexible, and in my own style. It’s about exploring and creating without feeling tied down by unnecessary limits.

If you want to work on something with me or share an idea, here’s how I operate:

- I prefer to deal in **Crypto** because:
  - It’s the closest I can get to being systemless and free.
  - It’s universal and secure in its own way (even though nothing is truly safe).
  - Decentralization is becoming more mainstream, and I’m aligned with that shift.

If this approach resonates with you, check out my website and see if it’s the kind of style you’d like to align with.
